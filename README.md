# 🏡 Listing Lab 🧪

A simple, friendly place to keep track of homes you’re looking at. Save listings, add notes, tag photos, and share the
short list with the people who matter. Listing Lab also keeps an eye on changes—like price cuts and status updates—so
your view of a property stays current without constant refreshing.

Under the hood, this repo includes the Listing Lab Odoo addon, a small scraper service, and a Docker Compose setup to
run everything locally.

## Typical data flow

1) User requests property, and sets an address. They click "Update Property"
2) A message is published to RabbitMQ
3) The scraper consumes, calls HomeHarvest, and transforms results
4) Records are created/updated in Odoo
5) Odoo UI uses live record data and reflects the latest photos, popularity, and details

## Updating

If you are updating your application, be sure to upgrade the UI by clicking the square icon in the top left, selecting
"Apps" and upgrading the Adomi - Listing Lab application.
