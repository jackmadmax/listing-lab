# 🏡 Listing Lab 🧪

A simple, friendly place to keep track of homes you’re looking at. Save listings, add notes, tag photos, and share the
short list with the people who matter. Listing Lab also keeps an eye on changes—like price cuts and status updates—so
your view of a property stays current without constant refreshing.

Under the hood, this repo includes the Listing Lab Odoo addon, a small scraper service, and a Docker Compose setup to
run everything locally.

## Highlights

- 🏠 Property listing management inside Odoo
- 🗂️ Save, tag, and organize the homes you’re considering
- 🖼️ Photo management with simple tagging
- 📈 Popularity tracking when available
- 🏡 Realtor.com data via HomeHarvest (v0.7.0+)
- 📨 Background scraping powered by RabbitMQ
- 🤖 Optional ChatGPT/OpenAI analysis (bring your own API key)

## What you can do

- Keep a list of properties you care about
- Add notes, tags, and photos to remember what stood out
- See popularity hints when available (views, saves, clicks)
- Pull fresh details from Realtor.com so your info doesn’t go stale

## Typical data flow

1) User requests property, and sets an address. They click "Update Property"
2) A message is published to RabbitMQ
3) The scraper consumes, calls HomeHarvest, and transforms results
4) Records are created/updated in Odoo
5) Odoo UI uses live record data and reflects the latest photos, popularity, and details
